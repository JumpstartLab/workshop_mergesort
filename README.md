# Merge Sort

> Merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an O(n log n) comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.[1] A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up mergesort appeared in a report by Goldstine and Neumann as early as 1948.[2]

# Paths

## Languages

We've setup some stubs to get you started with different languages.

### Ruby

Assuming you already have Ruby installed, run the Ruby stubs with:

```bash
rake ruby
```

### Javascript (node.js)

First, install Node.js using Homebrew:

    > brew install node

Then run the stubs:

```bash
rake node
```

### Coffeescript

Install Node.js and CoffeeScript

    > brew install node
    > npm install -g coffee-script

Then run the CoffeeScript stubs:

```bash
rake coffee
```

### Scala

Install Scala via homebrew:

    > brew install scala

Then run the stubs:

```bash
rake scala
```

### Clojure

Install Clojure via homebrew:

    > brew install clojure

Then run the stubs:

```bash
rake clojure
```

## Test Driven Paths

### Ruby with MiniTest

```bash
rake ruby:minitest
```

### Ruby with RSpec

```bash
rake ruby:rspec
```

### Javascript with Jasmine

[Jasmine](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine) is a JavaScript Testing Framework

> Jasmine is a Behavior Driven Development testing framework for JavaScript. It does not rely on browsers, DOM, or any JavaScript framework. Thus it's suited for websites, Node.js projects, or anywhere that JavaScript can run.

We've already setup Jasmine for you in this repo, so you can just run:

```bash
rake jasmine
```
