# Merge Sort

> Merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an O(n log n) comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.[1] A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up mergesort appeared in a report by Goldstine and Neumann as early as 1948.[2]

# Paths

## Languages

We've setup some stubs to get you started with different languages.

### Ruby

#### Ruby with MiniTest

Initialize your own copy of the project:

```bash
rake ruby:minitest:init AUTHOR=your_github_username
```

Then run the tests:

```bash
rake ruby:minitest:run AUTHOR=your_github_username
```

#### Ruby with RSpec

Initialize your own copy of the project:

```bash
rake ruby:rspec:init AUTHOR=your_github_username
```

Then run the tests:

```bash
rake ruby:rspec:run AUTHOR=your_github_username
```

### Javascript 

#### Pure JavaScript with Jasmine

[Jasmine](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine) is a JavaScript Testing Framework

> Jasmine is a Behavior Driven Development testing framework for JavaScript. It does not rely on browsers, DOM, or any JavaScript framework. Thus it's suited for websites, Node.js projects, or anywhere that JavaScript can run.

Initialize your own copy of the project:

```bash
rake js:jasmine:init AUTHOR=your_github_username
```

Then run/open the specs:

```bash
rake js:jasmine:run AUTHOR=your_github_username
```


#### Node.js

First, install Node.js using Homebrew:

    > brew install node

Then run the stubs:

```bash
rake node
```

#### Coffeescript

Install Node.js and CoffeeScript

    > brew install node
    > npm install -g coffee-script

Then run the CoffeeScript stubs:

```bash
rake coffee
```

### Scala

Install Scala via homebrew:

    > brew install scala

Then run the stubs:

```bash
rake scala
```

### Clojure

Install Clojure via homebrew:

    > brew install clojure

Then run the stubs:

```bash
rake clojure
```
